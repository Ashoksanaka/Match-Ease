# Virtual-Try-On ðŸ‘š
This project aims to revolutionize the online shopping experience by providing users with a virtual try-on platform. By allowing users to see how clothing will look on their own bodies in real-time, the app 
eliminates the guesswork of purchasing clothes online. Users simply enter a product URL, capture an image of themselves using their webcam, and the app overlays the clothing onto their body. With features like a 360-degree view, background removal, and real-time clothing fitting, users can confidently decide whether the product suits them before making a purchase. The app is designed to be fast, easy to use, and accessible on any device, without the need for user accounts or logins.

## Features ðŸ“±
- Users enter a URL of a clothing product, and the app fetches the product image and details.
- Users take a photo of themselves using their webcam.
- The app places the selected clothing on the userâ€™s body.
- Users can rotate the view to see how the clothing looks from all angles.
- The userâ€™s background is removed or replaced with a solid color during the try-on.
- Users can save the augmented image or share it on social media.
- The clothing is instantly fitted to the userâ€™s body and displayed in real-time.
- The app works on any device (PC, tablet, or mobile).
- No need for user accounts or loginsâ€”just enter a URL and try on clothes.
- Works on all major browsers like Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.
- Uses AI to segment the userâ€™s body and fit the clothing properly.
- Images and augmented results are stored securely in the cloud.
- Advanced AR features for a more immersive try-on experience (optional).

## Technology Stack ðŸ§°
### **Frontend:**
- **React.js:** Used to build the interactive user interface and manage dynamic content (like clothing selection and real-time fitting).
- **Three.js:** For rendering 3D models of the clothing and adding AR features (e.g., rotating the view of clothing).
- **WebRTC:** To capture the userâ€™s webcam feed for the virtual try-on.
- **Tailwind CSS:** For quick and responsive styling.
- **Canvas API:** For manipulating images (e.g., removing the background).

### **Backend:**
- **Flask:** A lightweight Python web framework to handle server-side logic, requests, and serve HTML pages.
- **Flask-SocketIO:** For real-time communication between the frontend (React) and backend (Flask), especially for updating the clothing fit in real-time.
- **TensorFlow/PyTorch:** For processing the userâ€™s body and fitting clothing using AI.
- **OpenCV:** For tasks like removing or replacing the background in user images.

### **AI/AR Features:**
- **Body Segmentation (TensorFlow/PyTorch):** AI models to detect the user's body and fit the clothing accordingly.
- **Augmented Reality (WebXR or AR.js):** To overlay the clothing on the userâ€™s body and allow real-time adjustments.

### **Storage and Deployment:**
- **Cloud Storage (S3/Google Cloud Storage):** For storing images or temporary data.
- **AWS EC2/Google Cloud:** For hosting your backend services.
- **Docker:** To package and deploy the application easily.

### **Security and Privacy:**
- **HTTPS/TLS:** To ensure secure communication between the user and the server.
- **CORS:** For allowing safe cross-origin requests between frontend (React) and backend (Flask).

### **DevOps & Monitoring:**
- **GitHub Actions:** For automating testing and deployment.
- **Sentry:** To track errors and monitor app performance.

### **Cross-Platform Compatibility:**
- **PWA (Progressive Web App):** To ensure your app works smoothly on all devices (PC, tablet, and mobile).
